# multifriction-autonomous-drive
Currently deploying an Unscented Kalman Filter for the F1tenth autonomous car to enable precise state estimation. Developed a comprehensive Python-based state estimation script for diligent logging of vehicle sensor data. This data is then compared with ground truth values to assess and enhance the filter's performance. Simulated model in Pychrono.
